![](/assets/easy-ble-esp32-showcase.gif)
### Description
The `Easy BLE` library is an advanced BLE management tool for `ZeppOS v3+` watches that features an automated profile generator, a hybrid asynchronous and sequential queue for efficient handling of all operations including writing and reading, user-friendly string-based interactions, seamless auto-conversions of data and addresses, support for multiple data types, and simplified device management through MAC address-centric commands, all designed to enhance usability and streamline BLE communications.

## To install the library run (from the root of your project)
```bash
npm i @silver-zepp/easy-ble
```

## ‚ú®Ô∏è Full Communications Example
```js
// install -> npm i @silver-zepp/easy-ble
import { BLEMaster } from "@silver-zepp/easy-ble";
const ble = new BLEMaster();

// the mac of a device you are connecting to
const MAC = "1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F";

// simplified object that describes a profile
const services = {
  // service #1
  "FF00": {       // service UUID
    "FF02": [],         // READ chara UUID
    "FF03": ["2902"],   // NOTIFY chara UUID
            //  ^--- descriptor UUID
  },
  // ... add other services here if needed
}

// connect to a device
ble.connect(MAC, (connect_result)=>{
  // proceed further if [bool] connected is true
  if (connect_result.connected){
    // generate a complex profile object providing description of its services 
    const profile_object = ble.generateProfileObject(services);
    
    // start listening for the response from watch's backend
    ble.startListener(profile_object, (response)=> {
      if (response.success){
        // first subcribe to the events
        ble.on.charaValueArrived((uuid, data, len)=> {
            console.log("Read result:", uuid, data, len);
          }
        );
        
        // then manipulate - read/write/etc
        ble.read.characteristic("FF02");
        
        // As a result you should log
        // Read result: 'FF02' 'BAT_LVL_77' '10'
      }

```

#### Returns
{boolean} true if the scan started successfully, false otherwise.


### `stopScan()`

## üìçHelpers (methods, collections)

### `function ab2hex(buffer)`

Converts an ArrayBuffer to a string of hexadecimal numbers. This function is useful when you need to represent binary data in a readable hexadecimal string format. For example, it can be used to display BLE device addresses or data in a human-readable form.

#### Parameters

- `buffer` {ArrayBuffer} - The ArrayBuffer to be converted.

#### Examples

```js
// Convert an ArrayBuffer to a hexadecimal string
const buffer = new Uint8Array([10, 20, 30]).buffer;
const hex_str = ab2hex(buffer);
console.log(hex_str); // Output: '0A 14 1E'
```
### Returns
{string} The hexadecimal string representation of the ArrayBuffer. Each byte is represented as a two-character hex code.


### `function ab2str(buffer)`

Converts an ArrayBuffer into a string. This function is used when you need to convert binary data (ArrayBuffer) into a regular JavaScript string. It's particularly useful for converting data received from BLE devices into text, assuming the data represents text in a compatible encoding (e.g., UTF-8).

#### Parameters

- `buffer` {ArrayBuffer} - The ArrayBuffer to be converted.

#### Examples

```js
// Convert an ArrayBuffer to a string
const buffer = new Uint8Array([72, 101, 108, 108, 111]).buffer; // 'Hello' in ASCII
const str = ab2str(buffer);
console.log(str); // output: 'Hello'
```
### Returns
{string} The resulting string. Note that the output is dependent on the encoding of the byte data in the ArrayBuffer.


### `function ab2num(buffer)`

Converts an ArrayBuffer to a number. This function is useful when you need to represent binary data in a readable number format. For example, it can be used to display BLE device battery levels or other data in a human-readable form.

#### Parameters
- `{ArrayBuffer} buffer` - The ArrayBuffer to be converted.

#### Examples

```js
// example: convert an ArrayBuffer to a number
const buffer = new Uint8Array([81]).buffer;
const num = ab2num(buffer);
console.log(num); // Output: 81
```
#### Returns
{number} The number representation of the ArrayBuffer.



### `const PERMISSIONS = {...}`

Object containing BLE permissions. Each permission is a property with a detailed description and a numeric value. In many scenarios, it's sufficient to use the built-in generateProfileObject(...) auto-permission 32. However, for complex and encrypted communications, specific permissions defined here may be required.

#### Properties

- `READ`: Allows reading the characteristic value.
- `READ_ENCRYPTED`: Allows reading the characteristic value with an encrypted link.
- `READ_ENCRYPTED_MITM`: Allows reading the characteristic value with an encrypted and authenticated link (MITM protection).
- `WRITE`: Allows writing the characteristic value.
- `WRITE_ENCRYPTED`: Allows writing the characteristic value with an encrypted link.
- `WRITE_ENCRYPTED_MITM`: Allows writing the characteristic value with an encrypted and authenticated link (MITM protection).
- `WRITE_SIGNED`: Allows writing the characteristic value with a signed write (without response).
- `WRITE_SIGNED_MITM`: Allows writing the characteristic value with a signed write (without response) and authenticated link (MITM protection).
- `READ_DESCRIPTOR`: Allows reading the descriptor value.
- `WRITE_DESCRIPTOR`: Allows writing the descriptor value.
- `READ_WRITE_DESCRIPTOR`: Allows both reading and writing the descriptor value.
- `NONE`: No permissions granted.
- `ALL`: All permissions granted.

Each property is an object with a `description` and a `value`. The `description` is a string that explains the permission, and the `value` is a numeric value representing the permission.
